# Data Structures and Algorithms performance analysis
This project is dedicated to help anyone eager to 
understand and learn data structures and algorithms 
in a very succinct and conceptualize manner. 

## About this project
The goal of this project is help you understand the inner workings 
of some of the most common yet powerful data structures and some
ways of writing and implementing the algorithms which will effectively
act as intelligent patterns for solving simpler to complex real
life problems.
